# wkt_inject
WKT code (https://github.com/edkontar/wkt) with added injection of electrons (the code starts without an electron beam)
The equations are modified to include a source of electrons 
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}=.... +g(v)\exp \left(-(t-_t_0)^2 / \tau^2\right)/\tau $$
where the velocity distribution of electrons is $g(v)\propto exp(-(v-v_b)^2/v_b^2) $.
